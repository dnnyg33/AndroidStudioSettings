reasons android studio is better

clicking on errors for files with ../../ actually goes to the error
comment moves down a line
cmd+1 shortcut
interfaces can be clicked through
vcs/merge tools are better
tab auto completion doesn't overwrite words
option + arrow navigation recognizes distinct words in camel/pascal case
shortcut to remove all unused imports
floating tool windows maximizes use of dual monitors
find usages is faster and automatically shows in window so that it doesn't disappear when any click occurs
class lookup and other finds don't erase previously entered text
don't need to press save, ever


reasons its worse
auto format doesn't run with each save command
file structure feels less cluttered/more easily navigable
Live pairing
